				<p>It’s a common misconception that the Chernobyl Nuclear Power plant is devoid of life–in fact there are over 3,500 people each day who work among over 250 stray dogs that roam the grounds.</br>
				Overpopulation of dogs in Europe is a well-known problem, there are an estimated 30,000 stray cats and dogs in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev alone, but the Chernobyl dogs are different.  These dogs are the descendants of pets left behind during the hasty evacuation in 1986.  They have been driven out of remote areas in the zone by packs of rabid wolves that attack them.  The Chernobyl dogs are malnourished, have been exposed to rabies by wild predators in the zone, and are in dire need of medical attention.</p>
